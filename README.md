Blockchain-Based Secure Cloud Storage with Data Deduplication (Django)

This project is a Django-based secure cloud storage system enhanced with Blockchain technology and data deduplication. It ensures data integrity, privacy, and optimized storage usage by eliminating redundant file uploads and storing verified file hashes on a blockchain ledger to prevent tampering.

--Key Features

✔ Django-powered backend
✔ Blockchain ledger for secure and immutable validation
✔ Data deduplication to reduce storage usage
✔ File hashing and encryption for secure uploads
✔ Proof-of-ownership and authentication system
✔ User-friendly web interface

--System Workflow

User uploads a file
Django generates a secure hash
Blockchain checks if the hash already exists
If duplicate → only metadata stored
If new → file encrypted and securely stored
Hash recorded on blockchain for transparency and verification

--Technology Stack
Truffle framework
Ganache network
IPFS
Metamask extension
